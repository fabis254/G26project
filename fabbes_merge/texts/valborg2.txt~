Now that spring is finally here, trust in Sweden to throw the biggest changing of seasons festival around- Valborg. Taking place every the 30th of April, Valborg celebrates everything spring (and in other parts of Europe, witches!). Its celebration in Sweden dates back to the 18th century and features bonfires, waterside excursions in rickety rafts and copious alcohol consumption.
